## How to:
First of all, you will need to place the servo on top of the space bar, make sure that the servo is able to push the spacebar down, put weight on top of it to do so.
Second of all, you need to place the light sensor on the perfect place on the screen with the perfect amount of delay for the dinausor to jump on top of the obstacles
#### Thats it! Now you can have a bot to play the dinosaur game for you :)
